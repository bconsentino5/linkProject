how to download everything for the game:
- if you're running python version 3:
    - to install pygame 
        - type "python3 -m pip3 install -U pygame --user" in the terminal
    - to install nltk for the word randomization aspect of the program
        - type "pip3 install --user -U nltk"
        - after that is done installing, type "-m nltk.downloader wordnet"
- if you're running other versions of python:
    - to install pygame 
        - type "python -m pip install -U pygame --user" in the terminal
    - to install nltk for the word randomization aspect of the program
        - type "pip install --user -U nltk"
        - after that is done installing, type "-m nltk.downloader wordnet"

to play the game:
- open combo.py and link_game.py
- press the play button in VS Code to run the program
- when you want to quit the game, either x out of the game screen
    or if that doesn't work, press control "c" in the terminal
- there are 20 hard coded levels before the game gets randomized. 
    if you want to get to the randomized part sooner, go to combo.py and on line 9, change max_levels to 2.
    this will make the randomized levels start after level 2
